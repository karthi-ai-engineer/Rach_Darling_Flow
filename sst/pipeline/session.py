"""The orchestrator: one Session per key press, from the first audio sample to the FinalText that is typed.

    Session.feed(block)      while the key is held: the chunker cuts chunks and the ASR workers start on them at once
    Session.finish()         key released (after the tail): the last chunk goes out
    Session.result()         waits for the ordered results, then merge -> dictionary -> formatting -> LLM -> guard

Sessions are isolated: every chunk and result carries its session id, so a slow answer for session A can never land
in session B (sst.pipeline.asr). If a chunk can't be transcribed, the session fails closed: nothing is typed rather than
a text with a hole in it, and the caller keeps the recording.
