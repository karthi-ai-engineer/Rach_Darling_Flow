"""Speech recognition for the voice pipeline (the plan's sections 17 and 22-32; failure policy 89-91; sessions 75-77).

silence, broken word times) before it is trusted, and a chunk that can't be transcribed fails its whole session
instead of quietly leaving a hole in the text. Nothing here knows about a particular provider: a backend is anything
with `name` and `transcribe(chunk) -> RawTranscript`, and EngineBackend adapts the existing sst engines.
