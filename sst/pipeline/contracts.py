"""The contracts between the stages of the voice pipeline (the owner's plan of 2026-10-01, "appropriate_plan").

    microphone -> ring buffer (pre-roll) -> session -> VAD -> chunker (pause / max, overlap)
    -> ASR workers (bounded, retried, validated) -> ordered results -> merge
    -> dictionary -> formatting -> LLM polish -> guard -> FinalText -> the existing paste

Each stage takes one of these objects and returns a new one, so every stage can be tested alone, a speech backend can be
swapped without touching the rest, and a wrong final text can be traced to the stage that made it (FinalText.stages).

Audio positions are sample indexes at the session's own rate (the microphone's: 16, 44.1 or 48 kHz), counted from the
session's first sample and never going backwards. Chunks are resampled to 16 kHz only when they go to a speech engine,
so no streaming resampler can smear a chunk boundary. Word times are seconds from the session's start.
