"""Merging the chunks' transcripts into one (the plan's §33-39).

A chunk cut at the maximum length is followed by one that starts a second earlier, so the words spoken in that second are
transcribed twice; after a natural pause that second is silence. Only the boundary is inspected: the end of the merged
transcript against the start of the next chunk, never the whole text, so long dictations stay fast.

Four levels, strongest first; the first confident one decides:
  1. timestamps: both sides have word times. A word of the next chunk is a duplicate when a previous word at the same
     time (TIME_TOLERANCE) has the same, a normalised or a similar text. When both sides are timed this level decides
     alone: times that disagree mean the user really said it twice ("very very"), whatever the text looks like.
  2. exact: the longest end of the previous text that is also the start of the next.
  3. normalized: the same, ignoring case, punctuation, apostrophes, unicode forms and "five" vs "5".
  4. fuzzy: the same, allowing spelling variants ("piza" for "pizza") over at least two words.
A text-only match must also be confident (`_confident`), or both are kept: losing a word the user said is worse than
typing one twice. Partial words at a forced cut ("Post" + "PostgreSQL") keep the whole word.
