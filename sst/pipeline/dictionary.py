"""The dictionary stage: the user's words ("Your words") turn known speech-recognition mistakes into the spelling the
user wants, deterministically (the plan's §41-49).

    "post grass is down, ask open ai's team about kuberneties" -> "PostgreSQL is down, ask OpenAI's team about Kubernetes"

Three kinds of change, all on whole words, never across sentence punctuation, and in the preferred term's own casing:
    case   the term itself, cased or spaced differently: "github" -> "GitHub", "java script" -> "JavaScript"
    alias  a spelling the user (or an accepted learned correction) tied to the term: "post grass" -> "PostgreSQL"
    fuzzy  a near miss by spelling or by sound: "kuberneties" -> "Kubernetes", trusted only above the term's threshold

A wrong replacement silently changes what the user said, which is worse than a missed one, so every rule leans towards
leaving the text alone: ordinary English words (static/common_words.txt) are never fuzzy-matched and never re-cased,
words of three letters or less are never fuzzy-matched, a word that is itself one of the user's terms is never turned
into another term, and a near miss that two terms explain equally well is left as it is. What was considered but not
trusted is listed in DictionaryResult.rejected, so a missed correction can be explained.

The terms live in SQLite (DictionaryStore), so the app, the learner and the engine share them and a dictionary of
thousands of entries stays cheap to edit; the engine keeps its own index and rebuilds it when the store's version moves.
