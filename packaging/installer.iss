WelcomeLabel2=This will install [name/ver] on your computer.%n%nRflow types what you say, in any app: hold Ctrl+Win, speak, and let go. It recognises your speech on this computer with NVIDIA Parakeet, downloaded once when you choose it (about 660 MB), or with a cloud model or your own server.%n%nIt needs no administrator rights.
FinishedLabel=[name] is installed.%n%nWhen you click Finish, Rflow opens and helps you choose how it recognises your speech, choose your microphone and try your first dictation. After that, hold Ctrl+Win in any app and speak.
